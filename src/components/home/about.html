              <p  ><span>RoyaltyRewards.</span><span>io</span></p><p  ><span>A</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>managed crowdfunding platform for hybrid smart contracts - connecting startup creators with cryptocurrency backers.</span></p><h1  ><span >Introducing Cross-Chain Mints</span></h1><p ><span>Welcome readers, to our alpha for Royalty Rewards! This is an open-source peer review for an Initial Mint Offering (IMO) whitepaper. Please leave comments in-line, send feedback to </span><span ><a  href="mailto:crown@royaltyrewards.io">crown@royaltyrewards.io</a></span><span>, and share the link below this with your network along with our </span><span >founding question</span><span >:</span></p><p ><span >Sharing Link: </span></p><p ><span ><a  href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/IMO8CRWN&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1521522598388000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEqPin89lRr_Mz0XIBd3l600__m-Q">http://bit.ly/IMO8CRWN</a></span></p><h2  ><span>&ldquo;How do I hold </span><span >and</span><span >&nbsp;earn FIAT returns at the same time?&rdquo;</span></h2><p ><span >The original idea was born of a small business owner and a crypto backer trying to connect their respective endeavours. Both serial entrepreneurs and digital coin holders, they soon realized the potential of solving an outstanding problem for emerging fintech: token circulation without exiting the system. By envisioning a platform that manages hybrid smart contracts backed in both the blockchain and fiat worlds, these two innovators expanded upon the very concept of an exchange.</span></p><h3  ><span >The Truth about Blockchain</span></h3><p ><span>Over the last few years, crypto has divided into three kinds of people: those who don&rsquo;t know about it, those who don&rsquo;t understand it, and those who are actively developing it. It is the last group who has unlocked the blockchain and brought it to the world, continuing to bring new things forward every day. They are the ones who will continue to code the future.</span></p><h3  ><span >Mainstream adoption is inevitable</span></h3><p ><span>A fundamental problem is that of </span><span >safe access</span><span >&nbsp;for everyone else. Wallets are notoriously human-fallible, and most blockchains are not designed for fraud prevention. In previous fields, history shows the next wave of tools will empower a greater participation on crypto networks by bridging these technology and usability gaps.</span></p><h3  ><span >A Permanently Expanding Web</span></h3><p ><span >Staking claims in this noosphere is the most productive way to advance the decentralized technology movement and discover new opportunities along the fringes of possibility. The idea economy is exploding - these ideas need to be backed by developers in order to not become vapourware. The Royalty Rewards program has a decentralized collective of small business owners, crypto backers, and skilled developers collaborating to realize the next solution: a crypto mint.</span></p><h2  ><span >Royalty Rewards</span></h2><p ><span >The revolutionary idea was to create individual smart contracts that unlocked milestone-driven rewards (similar to those used on existing crowdfunding sites) based on off-chain data from decentralized listener nodes. The DApp, Royalty Rewards, is used by small businesses to generate user-friendly escrow terms for peers and backers to connect with and to share one another&rsquo;s projects with the main net. Rule-managed wallets reduce user error and enforce distribution agreements using inviolable Gatekeepers.</span></p><h3  ><span >What is Royalty Rewards?</span></h3><p ><span>Royalty Rewards is an ERC20 smart contract that manages information exchange between its </span><span>child micro-tokens and the network macro-coins</span><span >. Crown (&#x1f451;) is a &ldquo;two-sided coin&rdquo; and knows its value relative to the network&rsquo;s backbone (in this case, Ether), so the internal ecosystem can operate according to programmatic rules independent of external activity. This makes Crown minted by Royalty Rewards subcontracts, authenticated with a Distributed Proof-of-Agreement system built on top of Ethereum&rsquo;s Proof-of-Work backbone.</span></p><h3  ><span >Intellectual Property Licensing</span></h3><p ><span >The IMO will distribute IP control of Royalty Rewards through the 0th-Edition token released under the GNU AGPLv3 software license. Nth-Edition Crown generated after the IMO will not grant this ownership privilege; however, so long as the generated micro-token maintains the AGPL text any commercial use is permitted. As a license, AGPL is preferable to the emergent ISC for this project due to both GNU&rsquo;s battle-tested history as well as additional consumer protection over the network.</span></p><h3  ><span >Hodl the Door</span></h3><p ><span >All Royalty Rewards are executed programmatically using Gatekeepers: filter-like conditional statements that listen to HTTP events captured via off-chain DNS servers and take actions such as escrow or transfer when a certain data threshold is met. These Gatekeeper-managed wallets are more secure for both Crown and its holders, as templated blockchain contracts are managed transparently in a high-level language that compiles to multiple platforms.</span></p><h2  ><span >Original Products And Content</span></h2><p ><span >Royalty Rewards is the first crypto exchange to be backed by human potential, as only verified creators of Original Products And Content (OPACs) can create profiles to be discovered by backers. If a typical crowdfund campaign is a marketed pitch to an anonymous audience, an OPAC is a code-backed agreement between partners in collaboration. Each OPAC has its own Crown (&#x1f451;) backed by live deliverables related to measurable progress.</span></p><h3  ><span >Bitcoins are worthless, Royalty Rewards are useful</span></h3><p ><span >The OPAC works by listing results, milestones and tiers similar to other crowdfunding sites. The human-readable hybrid contract is locked by programmatic Gatekeepers that govern backers&rsquo; blockchain escrow, who agree to the contract by trading for the minted Crown. Royalty Rewards verifies your data for the Gatekeepers to unlock the Royalty Rewards by processing submitted identification and external payment method APIs (two common examples).</span></p><h3  ><span >Immortal Proof of Concept</span></h3><p ><span >By registering an OPAC on the blockchain it is published, online, forever, in a way that supersedes any modern patent law. It is in everyone&#39;s best interests for the creators to succeed, and this concept includes maintaining Original Ownership: an OPAC automatically protects all rights in its legally-binding software license. Royalty Rewards gives creators and backers the security and reliability of code-based fulfillment.</span></p><h3  ><span >The Bottom Line</span></h3><p ><span >Half the platform is designed for exchanging code because, by doing so, we automatically qualify entities who are some of the least-risk-averse backers. While a network&rsquo;s long-term success depends on mass adoption, the developers agree that focusing on alpha testing with enthusiasts ensures short-term growth and sustainability. This means the early iterations of Royalty Rewards will learn rapidly from the community, and will be shaped by input from all stakeholders</span></p><h1><span>Architecture</span></h1><p ><span >System Components:</span></p><ul ><li ><span >PoA nodes (shared genesis block via Puppeth)</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >geth (1 instance)</span></li><li ><span >eth (1 instance)</span></li><li ><span >Parity (1 instance)</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Boot nodes</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >geth (1+ instances)</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Peer nodes</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >geth (2+ instances)</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Listener nodes, outbound</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Express (1+ instances) (Web3.js + HTTP subscriptions)</span></li><li ><span >Functions (serverless)</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Message store</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Real Time Database (RTD)<br>Connects to both listeners and triggers</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Trigger endpoints, inbound</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Functions (serverless)</span></li><li ><span >Locks (smart contract default functions)</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Key registry</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Storage (MD5 hash)</span></li><li ><span >Firestore (auth-generated accounts)</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Lock registry</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Firestore (auth-generated accounts)</span></li><li ><span >Mint (WebZ-generated accounts)</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Mail registry</span></li></ul><ul ><li ><span >Gatekeeper (smart contract)</span></li><li ><span >Storage (MD5 hash)</span></li></ul><h3  ><span >Managed Authentication Tools</span></h3><p ><span >Personal authentication is solved with Google Firebase. Firebase is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for app development, and uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP) serverless architecture components to provide real-time OAUTH-2 client support. DNS management also comes from GCP, so secure communication with GCP&rsquo;s APIs take advantage of being co-located within Google&rsquo;s network.</span></p><h3  ><span >Private in Public</span></h3><p ><span >The identity components disclosed and stored on the blockchain are merely references to internal IDs obtained from uPort, an Ethereum-based identity solution. This is the ID associated with verification/validation and as the owner of created OPACs. Access to resources connected to that ID, including wallets and tokens, are governed by the same security protocols across all forms of digital access: Gatekeepers. </span></p><h3  ><span >Appropriate Disclosure Built-In</span></h3><p ><span >The remote Crown verification process allows for photo and file upload through a separate web interface also powered by Firebase. Through this portal Crown is able to privately store user-submitted information used to prevent fraud by process of review and democratic consensus from the mint owners. Confirmed reports of abuse by any member is one condition that would release this information for legal or personal safety reasons.</span></p><p ><span ></span></p><h1  ><span ></span></h1><h1  ><span >MetaMask</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h1><p ><span >Block Diagram </span></p><p ><span >Refer to google sheets </span></p><p ><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 201.50px; height: 112.13px;"></span></p><p ><span ><a  href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16DjUfK7gSzNyuF1DXGrpe2fQtnKYVZADSvB4jEAZkQI/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1521522598394000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGJKgLhybdqGfoTy5i4ek62cg3x6Q">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16DjUfK7gSzNyuF1DXGrpe2fQtnKYVZADSvB4jEAZkQI/edit?usp=sharing</a></span></p><h1  ><span ></span></h1><h1  ><span >Distribution, Development, Deployment</span></h1><p ><span >Royalty Rewards is the smart contract which in turn is the root for all minted tokens held by backers as a Distributed Proof-of-Agreement. This means future changes to the DApp are designed to update the entire system without requiring a disruptive fork. Adding new components is non-breaking as all OPACs are automatically grandfathered into their original codified contract, so the development process takes advantage of industry-standard iterative deployments.</span></p><h2  ><span >Mint Distribution</span></h2><p ><span >A total of 88,888,888 0th-Edition Crown (&#x1f451;) will be created on the Ethereum chain. These tokens will be fully allocated at the close of the IMO by Gatekeepers. No Crown will be destroyed if unclaimed, instead being donated according to rules outlined below.</span></p><h3  ><span >The Wizard</span></h3><p ><span >A linear 4,444,444&#x1f451; (5%) per IMO stage for a total of 22,222,220&#x1f451; (25% - 2) will be transferred into a Wizard Wallet, an independent DApp designed to keep &#x1f451; stable and growing. These tokens act as a network bank and generally are for necessary expenses including Gas, DNS hosting, and bug bounties. The most regular access to these coins will be automated by Gatekeepers configured to mediate only necessary expenses: Any proposed breaking change to the Wizard code, including direct transfer or contract reprogramming, will be voted against using held tokens as a form of self-preservation.</span></p><h3  ><span >Developer Pool</span></h3><p ><span >To promote early progress, 8,888,888&#x1f451; (10%) of Gatekeeper 1 Rewards is reserved for the founding developers. G2 Rewards are half as much at 4,444,444&#x1f451; (5%), G3 2,222,222&#x1f451; (2.5%) G4 1,111,111&#x1f451; (1.25%), Final 1,111,111&#x1f451; (1.25%) for a total of 17,777,776&#x1f451; (20% - 2) of 0-th Edition tokens. Further gamified incentives come from milestones for ownership diversity in the IMO, increasing developer and owner token Royalty.</span></p><h3  ><span >Owner Registration</span></h3><p ><span >The IMO event unlocks an address for early access: 8,888,888&#x1f451; (10%) per stage up to 44,444,440&#x1f451; (50% - 4) over 5 (five) timed stages marked by Gatekeepers. This pool follows a capped redistribution model with pledges opening for a limited duration with an increasing exchange percentage with each stage - this ensures predictable spend to achieve a wider guaranteed token distribution for more diverse network participation. Each stage will open following a post-registration period for authentication and community building.</span></p><a ></a><a ></a><table ><tbody><tr ><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >Gatekeeper Date</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >Crown Available</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >Total %*</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >Exchange**</span></p></td></tr><tr ><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >TBD</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span ></span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span ></span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span ></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p ><span >*Rounded down for whole &#x1f451;</span></p><p ><span >**Min 1 Ether</span></p><p ><span >Charity Donation</span></p><p ><span >Finally, the remaining 2,222,238&#x1f451; (~5%) of backed Crown Royalty is donated in relative proportion to owner nominations of not-for-profit organizations requested at the end of distribution. Any additional Rewards not unlocked are donated as this time as well, to tilt the scales a little further to the side of Good. The individual owners should take on the task of coordinating with the organization they nominated to onboard them in the system.</span></p><h2  ><span >Crown Royalty Rewards</span></h2><p ><span >As the code for 0th-Edition Crown, Royalty Rewards is like a &ldquo;stamp&rdquo; for all Nth-Edition OPACs. Crown uses Royalty Rewards to levy taxes on network spend incurred by minted token activity. The impact of such platform programs remain consistent to the end user through the lifetime of their OPAC.</span></p><h3  ><span >Crown Royalty</span></h3><p ><span>Royalty is produced offline and delivered online. Data collected by HTTP listeners writes to a custom DNS in turn read by Gatekeepers, so authoritative Solidity code is executed on the blockchain and simply broadcast back out to other listeners. All</span><span>&nbsp;minted tokens share the same Royalty percentage</span><span >.</span></p><h3  ><span >Crown Rewards</span></h3><p ><span >Rewards work similarly to Royalty in how they pay a percentage to Crown at execution. Because Rewards trigger only once, the Gatekeepers for them automatically deregister afterwards. Crown Royalty Rewards are equal in value for clarity and simplicity, though they typically will not be identical for future OPACs.</span></p><h3  ><span >Gas Tax</span></h3><p ><span >CRWN is a token on Ethereum, and everything on Ethereum takes Gas. A Gas Tax is required (in addition to passing through the cost) because of shrinkage: inevitably, there will be fraud attempts, hard forks, and production bugs that lead to expenses unrecoupable but for a healthy Crown Bank. The Crown uses caching techniques to reduce Gas costs in minted contracts, so this truly is a balanced and necessary fee.</span></p><h3  ><span >Wizard Tax</span></h3><p ><span >The Wizard is expected to have regular outflow, so to achieve a self-evolving network the Wizard Tax deposits a percentage of transactions to its wallet. This specialized percentage decreases as Gatekeepers unlock diversity milestones for network. These meta-contract fees should be modifiable only by consensus of the developers and owners about with a clear need, such as higher-than-projected recurring hosting costs.</span></p><h3  ><span >Crown Holders Royalty Rewards Matrix</span></h3><a ></a><a ></a><table ><tbody><tr ><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >Gate</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >Crown Royalty</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >Crown Rewards</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >Gas Tax</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >Wizard Tax</span></p></td></tr><tr ><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >Start</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >0.5%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >0.5%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >30.0%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >3.5%</span></p></td></tr><tr ><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >G1</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >1.0%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >1.0%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >30.0%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >3.0%</span></p></td></tr><tr ><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >G2</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >1.5%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >1.5%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >30.0%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >2.5%</span></p></td></tr><tr ><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >G3</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >2.0%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >2.0%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >30.0%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >2.0%</span></p></td></tr><tr ><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >G4</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >2.5%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >2.5%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >30.0%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >1.5%</span></p></td></tr><tr ><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >Finish</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >3.0%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >3.0%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >30.0%</span></p></td><td  colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p ><span >1.0%</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2  ><span ></span></h2><h2  ><span >Milestones </span></h2><p ><span>We are currently in the process of creating our game.
